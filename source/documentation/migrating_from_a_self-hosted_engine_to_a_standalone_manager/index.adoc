== Migrating from a self-hosted engine to a standalone {engine-name}

:context: migrating_to_SAM
:migrating_to_SAM:

You can convert a self-hosted engine to a standalone {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} by backing up the self-hosted engine and restoring it in a new {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} environment.

The difference between the two environment types is explained below:

== Migration Overview

When you migrate from a self-hosted engine to a standalone manager, you first install the host operating system, install the required packages, and then restore the {engine-name} backup.

The migration involves the following key steps:

. xref:Installing_the_self-hosted_engine_deployment_host_migrating_to_SAM[Install a new host to deploy the standalone engine on.]

. xref:Updating_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_migrating_to_SAM[Update the original {engine-name} to the latest minor version before you back it up.]

. xref:Backing_up_the_Original_Manager_migrating_to_SAM[Back up the original {engine-name} using the `engine-backup` tool.]

. xref:Restoring_the_Backup_on_a_New_Self-hosted_Engine_migrating_to_SAM[Deploy a new self-hosted engine and restore the backup.]

. xref:Enabling_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_Repositories_migrating_to_SAM[Enable the {engine-name} repositories on the new {engine-name} host.]

This procedure assumes that you have access and can make changes to the original {engine-name}.

.Prerequisites

* FQDNs prepared for your {engine-name}. Forward and reverse lookup records must both be set in the DNS. The new {engine-name} must have the same FQDN as the original {engine-name}.

// Adding context back after this assembly, which includes its own context. There's probably a better way that assemblies within assemblies is meant to be done.
:context: migrating_to_SAM

Before backing up the {engine-name}, ensure it is updated to the latest minor version. The {engine-name} version in the backup file must match the version of the new {engine-name}.

After backing up the {engine-name}, deploy the new standalone server, enable the {engine-name} repositories on the new {engine-name} host, install the required software, and restore the backup on the new host.

include::common/install/proc-Enabling_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager_Repositories.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

The {virt-product-fullname} {engine-name} has been migrated to a standalone setup. The {engine-name} is now operating in the standalone environment.

If the new environment is running without issue, you can decommission the original self-hosted {engine-name} virtual machine.
